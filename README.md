# My First HTML WebPage

## Project Overview

Welcome to my first practice webpage that I created to mark the start of my journey into web development. As my first webpage project, it is a 
simple HTML webpage designed to apply the fundamental conceptsd I have leanred in Chapter 1 of the book "HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites"
by Jon Duckett. It is a testiment to my first step in my self taught journey in learning HTML and web design.

importance of tags, and the basics of webpage design. I encountered challenges, such as properly structuring the document and using tags
correctly, but overcoming these has been incredibly rewarding.
